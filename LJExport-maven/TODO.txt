- make MainDownloadLinks with option to download from the archive

================================================

- LinkDownloader should handle if_ -> im_ repeat loads (HTML -> Image)
  May want make it use SmartDownloader instead of Web

- Chrome web headers (instead of Firefox), diff. Chrome versions (Win7/10) 

- unresolved FailedLinks.txt -> revert a.href and img.src to the link
  if original-src/href exists use Away(original)
  if it does not use Away(failed-kvfile URL)
  when putting into HTML don't overencode existing %xx, use encodeUrlForHtmlAttr(String url, boolean safe = true)
  delete failed files
  delete empty dir
  delete kvfile

+ implement new LJ login
- Firefox 4.41 login -- which headers?

================================================

Options:
