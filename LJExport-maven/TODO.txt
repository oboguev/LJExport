- make MainDownloadLinks with option to download from the archive

================================================

- LinkDownloader should handle if_ -> im_ repeat loads (HTML -> Image)
  May want make it use SmartDownloader instead of Web

- Chrome web headers (instead of Firefox), diff. Chrome versions (Win7/10) 

- unresolved FailedLinks.txt -> revert a.href and img.src to the link
    if original-src/href exists use Away(original) with ImgPrsSt unwrap
    if it does not use Away(failed-kvfile URL) with ImgPrsSt unwrap
    but if one is non-imgprx and another is imgprx, use non-imgprx
    save href/src to origina;-href/original-src if it does not exist yet  
    when putting into HTML don't overencode existing %xx, use encodeUrlForHtmlAttr(String url, boolean safe = true)
  delete failed files
  delete empty dir
  delete kvfile
  
- change failed-download-links.txt to original links:
  - change link-file src/href URL to Away(original-url) or Away(kvfile.key)
  - do not overencode %xx
    e.g.
