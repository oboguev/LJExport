Currently comment subtrees of the form "...and 29 more comments..." are not expanded,
because LiveJounal's "Expand all" action does not expand them.

Should repetitively locate all <span class="b-leaf-seemore-expand"> and trigger an <a> element
under them until all such span elements are gone.

Perhaps a better solution would be to rework PageReaderBasic to parse the comment tree
and then execute RPC JSON read operations programmatically, rebuilding the tree until
all comments are expanded.

This would however have to pull in even more specifics of LJ page structure
and RPC JSON response structure.
